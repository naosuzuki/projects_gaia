# projects_gaia
GAIA satellite data analysis tool.  

We read in GAIA database and extract info on Photometry, Parallax and XP Spectra.
XP spectra are used for SDSS spectra calibration.  SDSS photometry is also checked.   

We aim to make SDSS spectra to be spectrophotometric with the calibrated by GAIA XP, Pan Starrs Photometry and eventually LSST/ZTF photometric data and aim to calibrate SDSS-V DESI data as well

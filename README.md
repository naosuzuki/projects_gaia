# projects_gaia
GAIA satellite data analysis tool.  

We read in the GAIA database and extract information on Photometry, Parallax, and XP Spectra.ã€€XP spectra are used for SDSS spectra calibration.  SDSS photometry is also checked. 

We aim to make SDSS spectra to be spectrophotometric with calibrated by GAIA XP, Pan Starrs Photometry and eventually LSST/ZTF photometric data and aim to calibrate SDSS-V DESI data as well.

We also aim to make existing SDSS spectra to be spectrophotometric.
